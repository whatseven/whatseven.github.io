I am a master student in [Visual Computing Research Centre](https://vcc.tech/index.html) at [Shenzhen University](https://en.szu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Hui Huang](https://vcc.tech/~huihuang). Before that, I received my B.S degree in Software Engineering from [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/).

I am interested in the areas of Computer Graphics, Computer Vision and Robotics, especially on aerial path planning and both real-time and offline 3D reconstruction from different primitives.
